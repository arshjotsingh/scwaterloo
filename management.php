            	<h3>From Manager</h3>
            	<br>
            	<p>Chris Hughton, Our Manager places great emphasis on two aspects of management: <blockquote>"As a manager, I've got to make sure they have the correct training sessions. That they are disciplined. That creates a good environment."</blockquote> 

When Hughton was dismissed as Newcastle manager, Kevin Nolan told The Sun,<blockquote> "Sometimes at clubs, when a manager goes, there will be some players who are pleased to see the back of him ... But everybody liked Chris. He was very popular, not just with the players but everyone who worked for the club."</blockquote> </p>
